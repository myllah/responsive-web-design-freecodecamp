## Responsive Web Design Projects
The purpuse of the following projects is to use the concepts learnt so far to build five responsive webpages that fulfill freeCodeCamp's user stories.
See my solution for each project and its corresponding requeriments:

## Build a Tribute Page
I decided to built a tribute page for Patrick Jane, a fictional character and the protagonist of the CBS crime drama The Mentalist, portrayed by Simon Baker. See the Tribute Page [here](https://codepen.io/Myllah/full/poRNaWX "Patrick Jane's Tribute Page")

### User Stories

* User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
* User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
* User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
* User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
* User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
* User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
